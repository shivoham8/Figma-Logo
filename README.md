# Figma Logo

This HTML and CSS code creates a simple representation of the Figma logo. The Figma logo consists of four colored elements with different border-radius properties to achieve the desired shapes. Each element has a distinct color (orange, purple, blue, and green), contributing to the overall Figma brand colors. This code can serve as a starting point for building more complex designs or as a learning example for CSS styling.

## Description

The Figma logo replica is created with a combination of colored elements, each representing a specific part of the logo. The colors used include:

- Orange (`#fb7266`)
- Purple (`#A061FA`)
- Blue (`#2EBDFA`)
- Green (`#00CE84`)

The HTML and CSS code define a flex container (`figma-logo`) that holds individual elements with various shapes and colors. Adjustments can be made to the arrangement and styling based on personal preferences.

## Usage

Feel free to use and modify this code to create your own versions of the Figma logo or as a learning resource for HTML and CSS.
